# cron-for-windows
Use this little php script on your Windows 7/8/10 OS and run your crons just like your run it on *nix systems! The script currently supports ONLY PHP commands. More additions shall be done in future as and when needed. Please note that I'm not an expert PHP coder so please feel free to correct/make updates as, wherever and whenever needed.
